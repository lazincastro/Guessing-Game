# 🎯 Guessing Game

A simple number guessing game written in Ruby.

This project was originally created in 2017 as a learning exercise and later improved for better structure and gameplay.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

The game chooses a secret number within a range based on the selected difficulty level.

You have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.

After each guess, the game tells you whether the secret number is:

- Greater than your guess
- Less than your guess

Your score decreases based on how far your guess is from the correct number.
